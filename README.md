# CodeinPlace

Hello Codeinplace! 

This is my final project from Codeinplace. 
I'm doing this based on my question in daily life, what do I want to eat.

So this program will random my dish based on nationality or ingredients.
As I wrote in my code as disclaimer, this is my style to come up with my dish. 

This can have a lot of improvement. Such as:
1. Use nested dictionary to collect ingredients. And when the user give "c" as a choice, 
it should then make a reverse dictionary. So that, it could random a dish by ingredients.
2. More choices! This could be done as a file. 
Why didn't I do that? Because I try to avoid those dished, which cannot be surely categorized by nationalities.
